## Low-level input/output coursework

### **Objectives:**
***Designing, implementing, and calling low-level I/O*** procedures by writing ReadVal and WriteVal procedures for signed integers as well as getString 
and displayString macros.

### **Issues & Results:**
My primary issue was the writeVal macro as I was not able to succesfully
convert the integer to a string. This issue resulted in sum and average 
not being displayed correctly so I plan to return to this assignment in
the future.
